## Story - 7 : Where Do Strategic Minerals Come From?

The US Geological Survey publishes a list of Strategic Minerals ( https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/us-geological-survey-releases-2022-list-critical-minerals ). Having a secure supply of these minerals is essential to our security and economic prosperity. However many of these minerals are sourced from outside of the US. This assignment is to develop a reference catalog of the source or sources of each of these minerals and a judgement on the reliability of each source under stressed circumstance (e.g. war, economic crisis, etc.)
Notes:

- You will need to identify a source or sources for each of the minerals in the 2022 List of Critical Minerals

- You will need to categorize each source country as an ally, a competitor or a neutral party.

- You will need to develop data visualizations that tell the story of source dependency and shortfall impact.

This assignment is due at the end of week fourteen of the semester
