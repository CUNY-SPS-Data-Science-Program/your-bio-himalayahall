# Story 4

## INSTRUCTIONS
I have introduced the term "Data Practitioner" as a generic job descriptor because we have so many different job role titles for individuals whose work activities overlap including Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Analyst, Business Analyst, Data Architect, etc.
For this story we will answer the question, "How much do we get paid?" Your analysis and data visualizations must address the variation in average salary based on role descriptor and state.
Notes:
You will need to identify reliable sources for salary data and assemble the data sets that you will need.

Your visualization(s) must show the most salient information (variation in average salary by role and by state).

For this Story you must use a code library and code that you have written in R, Python or Java Script (additional coding in other languages is allowed).

Post generation enhancements to you generated visualization will be allowed (e.g. Addition of kickers and labels).

This assignment is due at the end of the week eight of the semester.

# Data Practicioner Salary Data
I used ZipRecruiter as the source of all data. Speifically, the following strategy was used to acquire data:

- Search for job titles on ZipRecuiter that 'sound like' a Data Practicioner
- Plugin  job title into the ZipRecruiter Average Salary by State query URL. For example, for the <b>Data Engineer</b> job title the URL is https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/What-Is-the-Average-Data-Engineer-Salary-by-State
- Save data (if available) in CSV file

After a lot of trial and error, data for the following job titles was acquired:

- Business Analyst
- Data Analyst
- Data Engineer
- Data Scientist
- Data Warehouse Engineer
- Machine Learning Engineer
